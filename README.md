# Project #1 TO-DOs:
# 1. Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).
# 2. Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
# 3. Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
# 4. Use Hvplot or GeoViews to create six to eight data visualizations (ideally, at least two per question asked of the data).
# 5. Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.
# 6. Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.
# 7. Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
# 8. Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each question you asked of your data and under each heading a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
